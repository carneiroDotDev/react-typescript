## Hello =D, 

this is a create-react-app sandbox that I used to try typescript + hooks + context + containers. 

[Click here to check the live preview](https://carneirodotdev.github.io/react-typescript//)

If you wanna check it local: give it a `docker-compose up --build`
or of course the typical `yarn start` after installing dependencies. 

Have fun =D
